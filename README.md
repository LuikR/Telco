EDA and Dashboard development on the Telco Churn Dataset 

In this project I have done the EDA in Python, developed my own Python  module to ease some statistical tasks. Second I have developed and tuned a classification model to predict churn. 
Finally I have developed a PowerBI Dashboard with the following pages: Service Quality as measured through Churn Rate, a Customer Profile page segmented in Loyal customers and Churners with the function to do multivariate EDA, a page for individual customer analysis with the classification model implementation and finally a page displaying a executive summary for a quick overview of company health and performance.
